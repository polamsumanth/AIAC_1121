        "\n",
        "Let's break down the Python function `calculate_area()` so a junior developer can easily understand each part:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **`import math`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This line brings in a special collection of tools from Python called the `math` module. This module contains many mathematical functions and constants, like `pi` (π), which we need for calculating the area of a circle.\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** Without `import math`, Python wouldn't know what `math.pi` means, and our circle area calculation would fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **`def calculate_area():`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This defines a new function named `calculate_area`. A function is like a mini-program that you can run whenever you need it. The `()` indicates that this function doesn't need any information passed into it when you call it.\n",
        "    *   **Why we use it:** Functions help organize our code, make it reusable, and prevent us from writing the same code multiple times.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **`\"\"\"\n",
        "    Calculates the area of a circle, square, or rectangle based on user input.\n",
        "    \"\"\"`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This is called a docstring (documentation string). It's a triple-quoted string right after the function definition.\n",
        "    *   **Why we use it:** It's a description of what the function does. It helps anyone (including you later) understand the purpose of the function without reading all the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **`shape = input(\"Enter the shape (circle, square, rectangle): \").lower()`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:**\n",
        "        *   `input(...)` displays the message \"Enter the shape (circle, square, rectangle): \" to the user in the console and waits for them to type something and press Enter.\n",
        "        *   Whatever the user types is then stored as text (a string) in a variable named `shape`.\n",
        "        *   `.lower()` converts the user's input to all lowercase letters (e.g., if they type \"Circle\", it becomes \"circle\"). This makes it easier to compare later.\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** This line gets the first piece of information from the user: which shape they want to calculate the area for.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **`if shape == 'circle':`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This is a conditional statement. It checks if the text stored in the `shape` variable is exactly equal to the text `'circle'`. If it is, the code indented underneath this line will run.\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** This is how the program decides which set of calculations to perform based on the user's choice.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  **`    try:`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This starts a `try-except` block. The code inside the `try` block is attempted. If an error (specifically a `ValueError` in this case) occurs during its execution, Python doesn't crash but instead jumps to the `except` block.\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** This is for error handling. If the user types text (like \"abc\") instead of a number for the radius, converting it to a `float` would cause an error. `try-except` prevents the program from stopping unexpectedly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  **`        radius = float(input(\"Enter the radius of the circle: \"))`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** Similar to getting the shape, this line asks the user for the circle's radius. `float(...)` then tries to convert the text input into a decimal number (e.g., \"5\" becomes `5.0`, \"3.14\" becomes `3.14`).\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** We need the radius as a number to perform mathematical calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  **`        if radius < 0:`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This checks if the entered `radius` is a negative number.\n",

        "\n",
        "10. **`            return`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This keyword immediately stops the function `calculate_area()` from running further and goes back to where it was called from.\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** If the input is invalid (like a negative radius), there's no point in continuing the calculation, so we exit the function early.\n",

        "11. **`        area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** This is the core calculation for a circle's area.\n",
        "        *   `math.pi` gives us the value of π (approximately 3.14159).\n",
        "        *   `radius ** 2` calculates the radius multiplied by itself (radius squared).\n",
        "        *   These two values are then multiplied together, and the result is stored in the `area` variable.\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** This applies the mathematical formula for the area of a circle (πr²).\n",

        "        *   `f\"...\"` is an f-string, a modern way to embed variables directly into strings. Python automatically puts the value of `area` into the string.\n",
        "        *   `{area:.2f}` is a formatting specifier. It tells Python to display the `area` number with only two decimal places (e.g., `15.197` becomes `15.20`).\n",
        "    *   **Why we need it:** To show the user the final result in a readable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **`    except ValueError:`**\n",
        "    *   **What it does:** If any line inside the `try` block above failed because of a `ValueError` (e.g., `float()` couldn't convert the input text to a number), the code here will execute.\n",
